# iate-dsl

## DESCRIPTION

Download IATE, the EU terminology database, in various language combinations and use it with .dsl compatible apps, such as Goldendict or Dictionary Universal.

### REQUIREMENTS

You need to have already installed a dictionary application compatible with the DSL format, such as: 
* Goldendict for Windows, Mac, Linux or Android  (http://goldendict.org/)
* Dictionary Universal for iOS (http://dictionary-universal.appspot.com/dictionary/en/)

### INSTALLATION

Download your preferred language combination from https://github.com/coding-linguist/iate-dsl/releases and install according to your chosen application's instructions.

In general, for Goldendict you need to decompress the .zip file and copy it to your dictionaries folder (that's the GoldenDict folder on Android). For Dictionary Universal you'll need to import the .zip file itself.

### KNOWN ISSUES

Alpus (formerly Fora) supports the DSL format, but does not currently support synonyms. Although iate-dsl can be used with Alpus & Fora, it will not display as supposed to.

### CONTRIBUTE

The perl commands used to generate the dictionaries can be found inside the files iate0 and iate.
